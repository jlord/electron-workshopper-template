# electron-workshopper-template
:computer: :microscope: A template for building workshops on Electron 

**Notes Prior to Development:**

Based on turning a NodeSchool.io workshopper, [Git-it](https://github.com/jlord/git-it) into an Electron desktop app I want to build a template so that anyone can do so. 

It will be one part static site generator and one part challenge verifier, with a really light frame work for displaying challenges and their completed status. 

See [Git-it Electron](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron).
